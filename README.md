# 🧠 Bare Metal

**Bare Metal** is a developer-themed word survival game built with React.  
Each incorrect guess removes a programming language from the ecosystem — until only **Assembly** remains.

> *This is the endgame of abstractions.*

## 🎮 How the Game Works

- A random word is selected at the start of each game
- Players guess letters using an on-screen keyboard
- Each wrong guess eliminates one programming language
- The game ends when:
  - ✅ The word is fully guessed (win)
  - ❌ Only Assembly remains (loss)
  - ⏱ The timer runs out
